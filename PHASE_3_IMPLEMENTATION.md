# Phase 3: Core Gameplay Systems - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Phase 3 successfully implements the core gameplay systems for WebGO FPS, building upon the refactored architecture and multiplayer foundation from Phases 1 and 2. All four major features have been implemented with full multiplayer synchronization and robust error handling.

## âœ… Completed Features

### ðŸ”„ 1. Weapon Switching System

**Implementation:** `systems/weapon-system.ts` + `components/game/hud/weapon-hud.tsx`

**Features:**
- **5-slot weapon system** (keys 1-5 for switching)
- **Multiple weapon types:** Rifle, Shotgun, Pistol (easily extensible)
- **Weapon-specific stats:** Fire rate, damage, range, accuracy, recoil, ammo capacity
- **Switching cooldown** (500ms) prevents rapid switching
- **Reload mechanics** with weapon-specific timing
- **Recoil accumulation** and recovery system
- **Visual feedback** for switching/reloading states

**Multiplayer Integration:**
- Real-time weapon state synchronization
- Other players see current weapon equipped
- Weapon switch events broadcast to all clients
- Server validates and relays weapon state changes

**UI Components:**
- Current weapon display with ammo counter
- Visual ammo bar with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- All weapon slots with unlock status
- Switching/reloading animations and feedback

### ðŸª“ 2. Tool Durability System

**Implementation:** `systems/tool-system.ts` + `components/game/hud/tool-durability-hud.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Durability tracking** for all tools (Hatchet: 100, Pickaxe: 80, Shovel: 60)
- **Usage-based degradation** with tool-specific loss rates
- **Efficiency scaling** based on durability (damaged tools work slower)
- **Warning system** at 20% durability threshold
- **Repair mechanics** with cost calculation
- **Tool-specific resource gathering** rates

**Visual Feedback:**
- Real-time durability bars with color coding
- Warning indicators for near-breaking tools
- Current tool highlighting
- Repair cost estimation
- Tool status icons (broken, warning, current)

**Multiplayer Sync:**
- Tool durability synchronized across all players
- Usage events broadcast for consistency
- Server-side validation prevents cheating

### ðŸ§± 3. Building Validation & Placement

**Implementation:** `systems/building-system.ts`

**Features:**
- **Grid-based snapping** (1-unit grid) for precise placement
- **Collision detection** prevents overlapping buildings
- **Distance validation** (max 10 units from player)
- **Ghost preview system** with visual feedback (green=valid, red=invalid)
- **Resource cost validation** before placement
- **Multiple building types:** Storage Box, Wall, Door, Foundation

**Building Templates:**
```typescript
Storage Box: 1.2Ã—0.8Ã—0.5 (Wood: 10, Stone: 5)
Wall: 2.0Ã—3.0Ã—0.2 (Wood: 5, Stone: 10)  
Door: 1.0Ã—2.5Ã—0.1 (Wood: 8, Stone: 2)
Foundation: 4.0Ã—0.2Ã—4.0 (Wood: 20, Stone: 30)
```

**Validation System:**
- Real-time placement validation
- Terrain height adjustment
- Bounding box collision detection
- Resource requirement checking
- Player proximity validation

**Multiplayer Features:**
- Building placement synchronized across all clients
- Server-side validation prevents invalid placements
- Ghost previews only shown to placing player
- Building ownership tracking

### ðŸ’¾ 4. Save/Load System

**Implementation:** `systems/save-system.ts`

**Features:**
- **IndexedDB storage** for persistent local saves
- **Compression support** (configurable)
- **Auto-save system** (60-second intervals)
- **Multiple save slots** (up to 5 saves)
- **Save metadata** with timestamps and previews
- **Import/Export functionality** for save sharing

**Save Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  playerData: { position, health, hunger, thirst, inventory, toolbar }
  worldData: { buildings, resources, placedItems }
  gameState: { playTime, difficulty, gameMode }
  weaponData: { weapons, currentSlot }
  toolData: { tools }
}
```

**Database Schema:**
- `game_saves`: Main save data with compression
- `settings`: User preferences and configuration
- `player_data`: Player-specific persistent data

**Error Handling:**
- Database initialization failure recovery
- Corrupted save data detection
- Save/load operation error reporting
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Configuration Management
All systems use centralized configuration from `lib/config/game-config.ts`:
- Weapon specifications and balance
- Tool durability and efficiency settings
- Building costs and dimensions
- Save system parameters

### Event-Driven Design
Each system implements event listeners for loose coupling:
```typescript
weaponSystem.onWeaponSwitchEvent(callback)
toolSystem.onToolUpdateEvent(callback)
buildingSystem.onBuildingPlaceEvent(callback)
saveSystem.onSaveCompleteEvent(callback)
```

### Multiplayer Integration
All systems provide synchronization methods:
```typescript
getStateForSync(): any
applyStateFromSync(data: any): void
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling throughout:
- Input validation
- State consistency checks
- Network failure recovery
- User-friendly error messages

## ðŸŽ® User Experience

### Weapon System UX
- **Intuitive controls:** Number keys 1-5 for weapon switching
- **Visual feedback:** Clear ammo display, switching animations
- **Audio cues:** Different sounds for each weapon type
- **Smooth transitions:** Cooldown prevents jarring rapid switches

### Tool System UX
- **Proactive warnings:** Durability alerts before tools break
- **Visual clarity:** Color-coded durability bars
- **Efficiency feedback:** Players see reduced effectiveness of damaged tools
- **Repair guidance:** Clear cost display for repairs

### Building System UX
