# Player Model Implementation

## Overview
The player character in WebGO now has a visible first-person body model that provides visual feedback and immersion for the player.

## Features

### Visible Player Body
- **Arms**: Positioned to be visible in the player's peripheral vision
- **Body**: Visible when looking down, providing spatial awareness
- **Legs**: Visible when looking down, helps with jump timing and movement
- **Hands**: Detailed hand models for better immersion

### Materials and Colors
- **Skin**: Realistic skin tone (`#d4a574`) with appropriate roughness and metalness
- **Clothing**: 
  - Body: Dark gray shirt (`#4a5568`)
  - Legs: Dark blue pants (`#2d3748`)
  - Feet: Black shoes (`#1a202c`)

### Animation
- **Walking Animation**: Subtle bobbing motion when moving
- **Arm Swing**: Alternating arm movement during walking
- **Leg Movement**: Subtle leg animation during movement
- **Body Sway**: Slight side-to-side movement during walking
- **Crouch Animation**: Body lowers when crouching

### Controls
- **V Key**: Toggle player body visibility (for debugging)
- **B Key**: Toggle wireframe debug mode

### Debug Features
- **Wireframe Mode**: Press 'B' to see the model structure
- **Visibility Toggle**: Press 'V' to show/hide the entire model
- **Console Logging**: Debug messages for state changes
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses memoized materials for efficiency

## Technical Implementation

### Positioning
The player body is positioned relative to the camera using Three.js groups and transforms:
- Body follows camera position and rotation
- Proper offset positioning for first-person perspective
- Crouch offset applied for realistic crouching
- Camera-relative positioning ensures proper visibility

### Performance
- Uses memoized materials for efficiency
- Minimal polygon count for good performance
- Only renders when visible to camera
- Optimized geometry reuse

### Animation System
- Smooth walking animations with proper timing
- Arm swing alternates naturally during movement
- Leg movement synchronized with walking
- All animations reset when not moving

### Integration
- Fully integrated with existing player movement system
- Respects crouch state and movement animations
- Compatible with all existing game mechanics
- Works with pointer lock and camera controls

## Usage
The player model is automatically visible when the game starts. Players can:
1. Look down to see their body and legs
2. See their arms in peripheral vision
3. Press 'V' to toggle visibility for debugging
4. Press 'B' to toggle wireframe mode for development
5. Experience realistic animations during movement

## Debug Controls
- **V Key**: Toggle player body visibility
- **B Key**: Toggle wireframe debug mode
- **Console**: Check browser console for debug messages

## Future Enhancements
- More detailed hand animations
- Weapon holding animations
- Clothing customization
- Injury/damage visual feedback
- Improved textures and materials
- Additional animation states (jumping, falling, etc.)
